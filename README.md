# whist_game
An optimization of the whist poker game with design patterns to leverage configurability and maintainability; extended the game by adding NPCs with various playing styles.

## Project description
Given the code of the poker game “whist”, we refactored the original architecture and added more functionalities for the players. Each game contains four players and games will be ended when one of the players reaches the target score. Players are defined by four types: human player, original NPC, legal NPC, and smart NPC. Legal NPC and smart NPC are the types we are required to complete. Legal NPCs are expected to play games without violating rules while smart NPCs are the improved version of legal NPC which are able to respond according to the cards played by other players. In this report, we will discuss how we design and why we chose to design like this in terms of the design patterns. Then further discuss the alternatives, the designed patterns we considered before drawing the conclusion.
